By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- import and wrangling time-series data by using appropriate tidyverse methods,
- visualise and analyse time-series data,
- calibrate time-series forecasting models by using exponential smoothing and ARIMA techniques, and
- compare and evaluate the performance of forecasting models.

# Getting Started

.pull-left[
For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, the following R packages will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, zoo, 
               timetk, modeltime, 
               trelliscopejs, seasonal,
               tsibble, feasts, fable)
```

+ [**lubridate**](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) provides a collection to functions to parse and wrangle time and date data.

## Importing the data

.pull-left[
First, `read_csv()` of **readr** package is used to import *visitor_arrivals_by_air.csv* file into R environment.  The imported file is saved an tibble object called *ts_data*. 

```{r}
ts_data <- read_csv(
  "data/visitor_arrivals_by_air.csv")
```
]

.pull-right[
In the code chunk below, `dmy()` of **lubridate** package is used to convert data type of Month-Year field from Character to Date.

```{r}
ts_data$`Month-Year` <- dmy(
  ts_data$`Month-Year`)
```

### Converting `tibble` object to `tsibble` object 
.pull-left[
Built on top of the tibble, a **tsibble** (or tbl_ts) is a data- and model-oriented object. Compared to the conventional time series objects in R, for example ts, zoo, and xts, the tsibble preserves time indices as the essential data column and makes heterogeneous data structures possible. Beyond the tibble-like representation, key comprised of single or multiple variables is introduced to uniquely identify observational units over time (index).

.pull-right[
The code chunk below converting ts_data from tibble object into tsibble object by using [`as_tsibble()`](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/reference/as-tsibble.html) of **tsibble** R package. 

```{r}
ts_tsibble <- ts_data %>%
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(`Month-Year`)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = `Month`)
```

What can we learn from the code chunk above?
+ [`mutate()`]() of **dplyr** package is used to derive a new field by transforming the data values in Month-Year field into month-year format. The transformation is performed by using [`yearmonth()`](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/reference/year-month.html) of **tsibble** package.
+ [`as_tsibble()`](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/reference/as-tibble.html) is used to convert the tibble data frame into tsibble data frame.

## Visualising Time-series Data

.pull-left[
In order to visualise the time-series data effectively, we need to organise the data frame from wide to long format by using [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) of **tidyr** package as shown below.

```{r}
ts_longer <- ts_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(2:34),
               names_to = "Country",
               values_to = "Arrivals")

```

```

## Visual Analysis of Seasonality

.large[
+ Time series datasets can contain a seasonal component.

+ This is a cycle that repeats over time, such as monthly or yearly. This repeating cycle may obscure the signal that we wish to model when forecasting, and in turn may provide a strong signal to our predictive models.

In this section, you will discover how to identify seasonality in time series data by using functions provides by **timetk** and **feasts** packages.

### Time series decomposition: timetk methods

.pull-left[
In the code chunk below, [`plot_acf_diagnostics()`](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/reference/plot_acf_diagnostics.html) is used to decompose the visitor arrival from Vietnam by air data.  The function Return the ACF and PACF of a target and optionally CCF's of one or more lagged predictors in interactive plotly plots.

## STL Diagnostics

STL is an acronym for “Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess”, while Loess is a method for estimating nonlinear relationships. The STL method was developed by R. B. Cleveland, Cleveland, McRae, & Terpenning (1990).

STL has several advantages over the classical, SEATS and X11 decomposition methods:

+ Unlike SEATS and X11, STL will handle any type of seasonality, not only monthly and quarterly data.
+ The seasonal component is allowed to change over time, and the rate of change can be controlled by the user.
+ The smoothness of the trend-cycle can also be controlled by the user.
+ It can be robust to outliers (i.e., the user can specify a robust decomposition), so that occasional unusual observations will not affect the estimates of the trend-cycle and seasonal components. They will, however, affect the remainder component.

### STL Diagnostics: timetk methods

.pull-left[
In the code chunk below, [`plot_stl_diagnostics()`](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/reference/plot_stl_diagnostics.html) of timetk package is used to perform STL diagnostics.

      "observed", "season", 
      "trend", "remainder"),
    .interactive = TRUE)

```{r eval=FALSE}
tsaPlot <- tsibble_longer %>%

  model(stl = STL(Arrivals)) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()
```

The grey bars to the left of each panel show the relative scales of the components. Each grey bar represents the same length but because the plots are on different scales, the bars vary in size. The large grey bar in the bottom panel shows that the variation in the remainder component is smallest compared to the variation in the data. If we shrank the bottom three panels until their bars became the same size as that in the data panel, then all the panels would be on the same scale.

### X11 Decomposition: feasts methods

.pull-left[
The X-11 method originated in the US Census Bureau and was further developed by Statistics Canada. It is based on classical decomposition, but includes many extra steps and features in order to overcome the drawbacks of classical decomposition that were discussed in the previous section. The process is entirely automatic and tends to be highly robust to outliers and level shifts in the time series. The details of the X-11 method are described in Dagum & Bianconcini (2016).

```{r eval=FALSE}
tsibble_longer %>%
  filter(`Country` == "Vietnam") %>%

    Arrivals ~ x11())) %>%
  components() %>%

               x = Vietnam)
