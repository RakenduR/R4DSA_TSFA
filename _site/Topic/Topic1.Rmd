By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- import and wrangling time-series data by using appropriate tidyverse methods,
- visualise and analyse time-series data,
- calibrate time-series forecasting models by using exponential smoothing and ARIMA techniques, and
- compare and evaluate the performance of forecasting models.

# Getting Started

.pull-left[
For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, the following R packages will be used.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, zoo, 
               timetk, modeltime, 
               trelliscopejs, seasonal,
               tsibble, feasts, fable)
```

+ [**lubridate**](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) provides a collection to functions to parse and wrangle time and date data.
+ [**zoo**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/) provides an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered observations, such as discrete irregular time series.
+ [**timetk**](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/reference/index.html) provides methods for analysing and visualising time series data stored in tibble data frame object.
+ [**seasonal**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seasonal/index.html) provides easy-to-use interface to X-13-ARIMA-SEATS.
]

.pull-right[
+ tsibble, feasts, fable and fable.prophet are belong to [**tidyverts**](https://tidyverts.org/), a family of tidy tools for time series data handling, analysis and forecasting.
    + [**tsibble**](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/) provides a data infrastructure for tidy temporal data with wrangling tools. Adapting the tidy data principles, tsibble is a data- and model-oriented object.
    + [**feasts**](https://feasts.tidyverts.org/) provides a collection of tools for the analysis of time series data. The package name is an acronym comprising of its key features: Feature Extraction And Statistics for Time Series.
+ [**trelliscopejs**](https://hafen.github.io/trelliscopejs/index.html) is an interface for creating Trelliscope displays in R environment.
